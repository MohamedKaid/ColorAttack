## Game Modes

### ⭐ Classic
- Tap the matching color card before the timer runs out
- "DON'T TAP" prompts — Tap any other color
- 3 lives — mistakes and timeouts cost a heart
- Tap timer speeds up as your score climbs

### ⚡ Rapid 
- 30-second countdown — score as many as you can
- No lives — wrong taps cost points
- Speed over caution

### 🌀 Chaos
- Two prompts per round: a **color** and a **shape**
- Match both from side-by-side grids before time expires
- Layouts may swap randomly to keep you on your toes
- 5 lives
